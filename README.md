# Model Fitting Using MLE

This code fits a model to a psychophysics dataset by maximizing the likelihood function using three optimization algorithms - the Nelder-Mead simplex method, a genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing. The code also runs an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, comparing parameters estimated by different methods.
Moreover, bootstrapping was used to calculate confidence intervals for estimated parameters.
